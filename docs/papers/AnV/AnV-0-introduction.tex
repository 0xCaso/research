In \S\ref{sec:parachains}, we first recall our tools like verifiable random functions, erasure coding, and state witnesses, and then describe the sharding problem and introduce our security definitions. 

We describe and instantiate our {\em availability and validity protocol} in \S\ref{sec:availability_n_backing} and \S\ref{sec:approval} that provides efficient sharding.  It roughly consists of 
\begin{itemize}
\item a parachain phase that prepares the candidate block and performs preliminary backing validity checks,
\item a relay chain submission phase that distributes candidate parachain blocks and produces relay chain blocks,
\item availability and unavailability subprotocols that enforce availability in GRANDPA and BABE respectively,
\item fuller approval validity checks for GRANDPA,
\item objection procedures for fishermen, and
\item invokation of a Byzantine fault tolerant ``finality gadget'' that gives us finality.
\end{itemize}
