%Think it again
%\begin{definition}[Risk Value]
%Given a total stake $S$ and slashing value $x$, the risk value is defined as $p\frac{x}{S}$ where $p$ is the probability of getting caught.
%\end{definition}

The active parties in the availability and validity scheme are validators, parachain validators, fishermen and collators. We assume that at most $ f $ validators out of $ n $ validators are corrupted where $n \geq 3f+1$. Malicious validators can collude with collators and fisherman. 


%\begin{itemize}
%\item Parachain validators are responsible to validate a blob. They can be malicious.
%\item Collators are the full nodes of parachain and provide a PoV blob to the responsible parachain validators. They can be malicious and collude with parachain validators.
%\item Validators are responsible for maintaining the relay chain and finalizing the blocks in the relay chain. A validator can also be a parachain validator. 
%\item Fishermen inspect any malicious activity. If any exists they announce and prove it.  
%\end{itemize}


%We note that $B\in PC$ (resp. $B \notin PC$) means that the block $B$ is a valid (resp. invalid) block for a parachain $PC$.


\begin{definition}[Security of Availability] The availability protocol is secure if the probability of having a finalized block in the relay chain which includes an unavailable block is negligible, then the availability protocol is secure.
\end{definition}

%More formal definition
\begin{definition}[Security of Validity]
The validity protocol is secure i the probability of having a finalized block in the relay chain which includes the header of an invalid block is negligible.
\end{definition}
