\section{Algorithmic considerations for the new election rule}\label{s:algorithms}

The goal of this section is threefold. 
First, we prove Theorem~\ref{thm:runtimes} and establish how our heuristic for candidate selection, described in Section~\ref{s:inserting}, can be computed efficiently. 
Second, we improve upon the runtime analysis of $\phragmms$ given in Section~\ref{s:315}, and show that each iteration can be executed in time $O(\bal + |E|)$, down from $O(\bal + |E|\cdot \log k)$. 
Finally, we provide further details on the similarities and differences between $\phragmms$ and $\phragmen$. 


As we did in Section~\ref{s:inserting}, we assume in the following that the election instance $(G=(N\cup C, E), s, k)$ is known and does not need to be given as input. Instead, the input is a partial solution $(A,w)$ with $|A|\leq k$. The list of member supports $(supp_w(c))_{c\in A}$ is implicitly passed by reference and updated in every algorithm.

We start with Algorithm~\ref{alg:maxprescore}, which shows how to find the candidate with highest parameterized score for a given threshold $t$.

\begin{algorithm}[htb]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Partial solution $(A,w)$, threshold $t\geq 0$.}
\lFor{each voter $n\in N$}{
compute $slack(n,t)=s_n-\sum_{c\in A\cap C_n} w_{nc}\cdot \min\{1, t/supp_w(c)\}$
}
\lFor{each candidate $c'\in C\setminus A$}{
compute $\prescore(c',t)=\sum_{n\in N_{c'}} \slack(n,t)$
}
Find a candidate $c_t\in\argmax_{c'\in C\setminus A} \prescore(c', t)$\;
\Return $(c_t, \prescore(c_t, t))$\;
 \caption{$\maxprescore(A,w,t)$}
\label{alg:maxprescore}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{lemma}
For a partial solution $(A,w)$ and threshold $t\geq 0$, $\maxprescore(A,w,t)$ executes in time $O(|E|)$ 
and returns a tuple $(c_t,p_t)$ such that $c_t\in C\setminus A$ 
and 
$$p_t=\prescore(c_t,t)=\max_{c'\in C\setminus A} \prescore(c',t).$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The correctness of the algorithm directly follows from the definitions of slack and parameterized score. The running time is $O(|E|)$ because each edge in the approval graph $G=(N\cup V, E)$ is inspected at most once in each of the two loops. The first loop also inspects each voter, but we have $|N|=O(|E|)$ since we assume that $G$ has no isolated vertices.
\end{proof}

We move on to computing the highest score. 
For a fixed partial solution $(A,w)$ and for a candidate $c'\in C\setminus A$, consider the function 
\begin{align}\label{eq:scorefunction}
f_{c'}(t):=\prescore(c',t)-t
\end{align}
$$$$ 
in the interval $[0,\infty)$. 
Notice from the definition of parameterized score that this function is convex, continuous and strictly decreasing with no lower bound, and that $f_{c'}(0)\geq 0$; hence it has a unique root corresponding to $score(c')$. We could approximate this root via binary search -- however, we can do better. 
Function $f_{c'}(t)$ is piece-wise linear: if we sort the member supports $\{supp_w(c): \ c\in A\}=\{t_1, \cdots, t_r\}$ so that $t_1 < \cdots < t_r$ for some $r\leq |A|$, then $f_{c'}(t)$ is linear in each interval $[0, t_1), [t_1, t_2), \cdots, [t_r, \infty)$.
%
Similarly, 
$$f_{\max}(t):= \max_{c'\in C\setminus A} f_{c'}(t) = \max_{c'\in C\setminus A} \prescore(c',t) -t$$ 
is a continuous and strictly decreasing function in the interval $[0,\infty)$, with a unique root $t_{\max}=\max_{c'\in C\setminus A} score(c')$. Unfortunately, this function is in general not linear within each of the intervals above.%
%
\footnote{It is easy to see that function $f(t)$ is piece-wise linear with $O(|C|\cdot k)$ pieces in total. Hence, one could find its root via binary search by making $O(\log |C|+ \log k)$ calls to $\maxprescore$. 
We present a better approach that only requires $O(\log k)$ such calls.} %
%
Still, it will be convenient to use binary search to identify the interval that contains $t_{\max}$. We do so in Algorithm~\ref{alg:interval}. The next lemma follows from our exposition and its proof is skipped.

\begin{algorithm}[htb]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Partial solution $(A,w)$.}

\If{$p_{t_r}\geq t_r$ where $(c_{t_r},p_{t_r})\leftarrow \maxprescore(A,w,t_r)$}{
	\Return $t_r$\;
}
Let $j_{lo}=0$, $j_{hi}=r-1$\;
\While{$j_{lo}<j_{hi}$}{
  Let $j=\lceil (j_{lo}+j_{hi})/2 \rceil$\;
  \leIf{$p_{t_j}\geq t_j$ where $(c_{t_j},p_{t_j})\leftarrow \maxprescore(A,w,t_j)$}{
  Set $j_{lo}\leftarrow j$}{
  Set $j_{hi}\leftarrow j-1$}
}
\Return $t_{j_{lo}}$\;

 \caption{$\interval(A,w)$}
\label{alg:interval}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:interval}
For a partial solution $(A,w)$, $\interval(A,w)$ makes $O(\log |A|)$ calls to $\maxprescore$, and thus runs in time $O(|E|\cdot \log k)$. It returns a value $t'$ with $t'\leq t_{\max}:=\max_{c'\in C\setminus A} \score(c')$, and such that for each candidate $c'\in C\setminus A$, the value of $\prescore(c',t)$ is linear in $t$ within the interval $[t',t_{\max}]$.
\end{lemma}

Moving on, for a candidate $c'\in C\setminus A$ and a value $x\geq 0$, consider the linearization of function $f_{c'}(t)$ at $x$ -- more precisely, the linear function that coincides with $f_{c'}(t)$ over the interval $[x, x+\eps]$ as $\eps>0$ tends to zero. 
If we denote by $r_{c', x}$ the unique root of this linearization, we have that
\begin{align*}
    0=& f_{c'}(r_{c', x})|_{\text{linearized at } x}\\
    =& \prescore(c', r_{c', x})|_{\text{linearized at } x} - r_{c', x}\\
    =& \sum_{n\in N_{c'}} \slack(n,r_{c', x})|_{\text{linearized at } x} - r_{c', x}\\
    =& \sum_{n\in N_{c'}} \bigg( s_n - \sum_{c\in A\cap C_n: \ \supp_{w}(c)< x}w_{nc} \\
		&- \sum_{c\in A\cap C_n: \ \supp_w(c)\geq x} \frac{w_{nc}\cdot r_{c', x} }{\supp_w(c)} \bigg) - r_{c', x},
\end{align*} 
%
where we used the definitions of parameterized score and slack. Solving for $r_{c', x}$, we obtain
%
\begin{align}\label{eq:linearized}
    r_{c', x}=\frac{\sum_{n\in N_{c'}} \Big( s_n - \sum_{c\in A\cap C_n: \ \supp_w(c)< x} w_{nc} \Big)}%
    {1+\sum_{n\in N_{c'}} \sum_{c\in A\cap C_n: \ \supp_w(c)\geq x} \frac{w_{nc}}{\supp_w(c)}}.
\end{align}

Now we make a couple of remarks about these linearization roots. 
First, since $f_{c'}(t)$ is a convex decreasing function, any linearization will lie to its left, and in particular any linearization root will lie to the left of its own root, i.e., 
$$r_{c', x}\leq \score(c') \quad \text{for each } c'\in C\setminus A \text{ and each } x\geq 0.$$

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
	\includegraphics[width={\linewidth},natwidth=300,natheight=270]{figure-maxscore.pdf}
  \caption{For each candidate $c_i$, the root $\score(c_i)$ of function $f_{c_i}(t)$ lies to the right of $r_{c_i, t'}$, the root of its linearization at $t'$. These two roots coincide for $c_2=c_{\max}$. }
  \label{fig:maxscore}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, for the candidate $c_{\max}$ with highest score $t_{\max}$, and for $x=t'$, the output of $\interval(A,w)$, we have that the corresponding linearization coincides with function $f_{c_{\max}}(t)$ in the interval $[t', t_{\max}]$, so the linearization root $r_{c_{\max}, t'}$ equals the function root $t_{\max}=\score(c_{\max})$. 
See Figure~\ref{fig:maxscore}. Consequently, %
%
\begin{align*}
r_{c_{\max}, t'} &= \score(c_{\max}) = \max_{c'\in C\setminus A} \score(c') \\
	&\geq \max_{c'\in C\setminus A} r_{c', t'} \geq r_{c_{\max}, t},
\end{align*}
%
i.e., $c_{\max}$ is simultaneously the candidate with highest score and the one with highest linearization root at $t'$, and these values coincide. 
We use this fact to find the candidate and its score. We formalize these observations in Algorithm~\ref{alg:maxscore} and the lemma below.

\begin{algorithm}[htb]

\KwData{Partial solution $(A,w)$.}

\Return $(c_{\max}, r_{c_{\max}, t'})$\;
 \caption{$\maxscore(A,w)$}
\label{alg:maxscore}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:maxscore}
For a partial solution $(A,w)$, $\maxscore(A,w)$ runs in time $O(|E|\cdot \log k)$ and returns a tuple $(c_{\max}, t_{\max})$ such that $c_{\max}\in C\setminus A$ and $t_{\max}=\score(c_{\max})=\max_{c'\in C\setminus A} \score(c')$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The correctness of the algorithm follows from the arguments above. 
Each of the \textbf{for} loops executes in time $O(|E|)$ because in each one of them each edge is examined at most once. 
The running time is dominated by the call to algorithm $\interval(A,w)$, taking time $O(|E|\cdot \log k)$.
\end{proof}

This completes the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:runtimes}. 
We highlight again that the heuristic for candidate selection in $\phragmms$ runs in time $O(|E|\cdot \log k)$, thus almost matching the complexity of the heuristic in $\phragmen$ which is $O(|E|)$ per iteration. 

Next, we reconsider the complexity of $\phragmms$ (Algorithm~\ref{alg:balanced}). 
At the start of each iteration with current partial solution $(A,w)$, notice by Lemma~\ref{lem:315localoptimality} that the highest score $t_{\max}$ must be lower than the least member support $t_1=supp_w(A)$. So, $t_{\max}$ lies in the interval $[0,t_1]$, and we can skip the computation of Algorithm $\interval(A,w)$ as we know that it would return $t'=0$. 
Without this computation, $\maxscore(A,w)$ (Algorithm~\ref{alg:maxscore}) runs in time $O(|E|)$, so the runtime of a full iteration of $\phragmms$ can be performed in time $O(\bal + |E|)$, down from $O(\bal + |E|\cdot \log k)$ as was established in Section~\ref{s:315}.

Finally, we discuss some similarities and differences between the $\phragmms$ and $\phragmen$ heuristics. 
For the sake of completeness, we present here the $\phragmen$ algorithm explicitly. 
We note that the version of $\phragmen$ proposed in~\cite{brill2017phragmen} only considers unit votes. 
In Algorithm~\ref{alg:phragmen} we give a generalization that admits arbitrary vote strengths. 
Clearly, each one of the $k$ iterations of the main loop runs in time $O(|E|)$, because each of the two internal \textbf{for} loops examines each edge in $E$ at most once.

\label{alg:phragmen}
\end{algorithm}

Assume that we consider inserting a candidate $c'\in C\setminus A$ to the partial solution $(A,w)$, and recall that for a voter $n\in N_{c'}$ approving of that candidate, and a threshold $t$, we define 
$$\slack(n,t)=s_n - \sum_{c\in A\cap C_n} w_{nc} \cdot\min \{1, t/\supp_w(c)\}.$$ 
%
This formula expresses the fact that to each current member $c\in A\cap C_n$, we reduce its edge weight $w_{nc}$ by multiplying it by a factor $\min \{1, t/\supp_w(c)\}$, and use the now-available vote strength from voter $n$ (its \emph{slack}) to give support to the new member $c'$. This edge multiplication factor is somewhat involved but sensible, as it removes a higher fraction of vote from members with higher support, and leaves members with low support untouched; see Section~\ref{s:inserting} for further intuition.

In contrast, in the same context, we claim that the $\phragmen$ heuristic can be thought of as using a constant edge multiplication factor $t/\supp_w(A\cap C_n)$, where we recall that $\supp_w(A\cap C_n):=\min_{c\in A\cap C_n} \supp_w(c)$. This is, of course, a much simpler approach, corresponding to a coarser solution rebalancing method. 

We now prove our claim. Suppose we use the edge multiplication factor above, and consequently define the voter's slack as
\begin{align}\label{eq:alt-slack}
\slack'(n,t):=s_n - \frac{t}{\supp_w(A\cap C_n)}\sum_{c\in A\cap C_n} w_{nc},
\end{align}
%
If we define parameterized scores and scores as before, we can retrieve the new score value for candidate $c'$ by finding the root of the function in equation~\eqref{eq:scorefunction}, which is now linear. 
With a similar computation as the one we did for equation~\eqref{eq:linearized}, we obtain
\begin{align*}
\score'(c') 
&=\frac{\sum_{n\in N_{c'}} s_n}{1+\sum_{n\in N_{c'}} \frac{1}{\supp_w(A\cap C_n)} \sum_{c\in A\cap C_n} w_{nc} } \\
&\geq  \frac{\sum_{n\in N_{c'}} s_n}{1+\sum_{n\in N_{c'}} \frac{s_n}{\supp_w(A\cap C_n)}}, 
\end{align*}
%
where the inequality follows by feasibility (inequality~\ref{eq:feasible}), and is tight if we assume that the current partial solution $(A,w)$ uses up all the vote strength of voter $n$ whenever $A\cap C_n$ is non-empty. If $A\cap C_n=\emptyset$, then $\supp_w(A\cap C_n)=\infty$ by convention and the corresponding term vanishes in the denominator. 
%
This new score, to be maximizes among all unelected candidates, corresponds precisely to the inverse of the \emph{candidate load} being minimized in the $\phragmen$ heuristic; see Algorithm~\ref{alg:phragmen}. The corresponding \emph{voter load} is in turn set to the inverse of $\supp_w(A\cap C_n)$, which the algorithm updates with the assumption that the new candidate $c'$ always becomes the member with least support. This completes the proof of the claim.

In view of this last result, we can say that our new heuristic provides two main advantages with respect to $\phragmen$: 
First, by using edge weights explicitly, the algorithm handles a more robust notion of loads. 
This enables $\phragmms$ to deal with arbitrary input solutions, a fact that we exploit in Appendix~\ref{s:LS}, and in contrast to $\phragmen$ which needs to make assumptions on the structure of the current solution at the beginning of each iteration.  
Second, our heuristic uses a better rebalancing method that provides more slack to voter $v$ for the same threshold $t$. Indeed, identity $\eqref{eq:slack}$ is at least as large as identity $\ref{eq:alt-slack}$, and usually larger. Hence, new candidates are granted higher scores and are added to the committee with higher supports.
