\section{Analysis of maximin support}\label{s:complexity}

Consider a multiwinner election instance $(G=(N\cup C, E), s, k)$ as defined in Section~\ref{s:prel}. 
In this section we present a computational complexity analysis of the maximin support problem, including new results both on approximability and on hardness. 

We start by establishing that our security objective \eqref{eq:security} is indeed equivalent to maximin support.
For this we use the fact that, by property 1 in Lemma~\ref{lem:balanced}, in maximin support we can reduce the solution space to only balanced solutions without loss of generality. 
The proof of the next theorem is delayed to Appendix~\ref{s:proofs}.

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:equivalence} 
If $(A,w)$ is a balanced solution, then
$$\supp_w(A) = \min_{\emptyset\neq A' \subseteq A} \frac{1}{|A'|} \sum_{n\in \cup_{c\in A'} N_c} s_n.$$
Hence maximin support, the problem of maximizing the left-hand side over all balanced full solutions $(A,w)$, 
is equivalent to that of maximizing the right-hand side over all full committees $A$. 
Furthermore, this equivalence preserves approximations, as any balanced solution $(A,w)$ provides the same objective value to both problems.
\end{theorem}

Next, we compare how some of the most relevant efficient election rules perform in terms of security, and highlight the effectiveness of the maximin support objective for preventing overrepresentation. 
Fix a committee size $k$ and consider an unweighted instance with $k+1$ voters and $2k$ candidates. 
For $1\leq i\leq k$, voter $n_i$ supports the candidate set $\{c_1, \cdots, c_i\}$, and the last voter $n'$ supports the candidate set $\{c_1', \cdots, c_k'\}$. See Figure~\ref{fig:example}.
%
We assume that an adversary controls the last voter and the last $k$ candidates, and will use any elected representatives to attempt to disrupt the duties of the committee. 
How many representatives will it get?

  \caption{In this example, the last voter and the last $k$ candidates are considered adversarial.}
  \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:badexamples}
For any $\alpha \geq 1$, in the example above the number of adversarial candidates elected by a rule with an $\alpha$-approximation guarantee for maximin support is at most $\lfloor \alpha \rfloor$. 
On the other hand, this number is $\Omega(\sqrt{k})$ for proportional approval voting (PAV), and $\Omega(\log k)$ for both $\phragmen$ and Rule X. 
Hence, none of these three rules guarantees a constant-factor approximation. 
\end{lemma}

The proof is delayed to Appendix~\ref{s:proofs}. 
For definitions of these rules, we direct the reader to the survey paper~\cite{lackner2020approval}.
We only remark here that Rule X~\cite{peters2019proportionality} is a recently proposed rule inspired in $\phragmen$ -- much as our own rule presented in the next section -- that achieves the EJR property. 

The maximin support problem was introduced in~\cite{sanchez2016maximin}, where it was observed to be NP-hard. We show now a stronger hardness result for it, which in particular rules out the existence of a PTAS.%
\footnote{A \emph{polynomial time approximation scheme} (PTAS) for an optimization problem is an algorithm that, for any constant $\eps>0$ and any given instance, returns a $(1+\eps)$-factor approximation in polynomial time.} 


\begin{theorem}
For any constant $\eps>0$, it is NP-hard to approximate the unweighted maximin support problem within a factor $\alpha=1.2-\eps$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{figure}[tb]

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth,natwidth=400,natheight=185]{figure-hardness.pdf}
  \caption{Reducing an instance of the $k$-independent set problem on cubic graphs to one of the maximin support problem. Set $N$ is represented by triangles and $C$ by circles.}
  \label{fig:hardness}
\end{figure}

\begin{proof}
We present a reduction from the $k$-independent set problem on cubic graphs, which is known to be NP-hard~\cite{johnson1979computers}. In this problem, one is given a graph $G'=(V',E')$ where every vertex has degree exactly 3, and a parameter $k'$, and one must decide whether there is a vertex subset $I\subseteq V'$ of size $k'$ such that no two vertices in $I$ are adjacent, i.e., $I$ is an independent set. 
Given such an instance, we define an instance $(G=(N\cup C, E), s, k)$ of maximin support where $k=k'$, $C=V'$ (each vertex in $V'$ corresponds to a candidate), and $N=E'$ with $s_n=1$ and $C_n=n$ for each $n\in N$ (each edge in $E'$ corresponds to a voter with unit vote that approves of the two candidates on its endpoints); see Figure~\ref{fig:hardness}.
Notice that in this instance, each candidate is approved by exactly 3 voters, and two candidates $c, c'$ have an approving voter in common if and only if $c$ and $c'$ are adjacent in $V'$.

Hence, if there is an independent set $I$ of size $k$ in $G'$, the same committee of validators in $G$ can be assigned the full vote of each of its three approving voters, so that each receives a support of 3 units, which is clearly maximal. On the other hand, if there is no independent set of size $k$ in $G'$, then for any solution $(A,w)$ of the maximin support instance there must be two committee members $c,c'\in A$ who have an approving voter in common. These two members have at most five voters approving either of them, so one of them must have a support of at most $5/2$. This shows that $\supp_w(A)\leq 5/2$ for any feasible solution $(A,w)$. Finally, the ratio between the objective values $3$ and $5/2$ is $6/5=1.2>\alpha$, so the assumed $\alpha$-approximation algorithm for maximin support would allow us to distinguish between these two cases and decide whether such an independent set $I$ exists. This completes the proof.
\end{proof}

In contrast, we show that the recently proposed $\MMS$ rule~\cite{sanchez2016maximin}, known to achieve the PJR property, also provides a 2-approximation for maximin support. 
In simple terms, $\MMS$ (Algorithm~\ref{alg:mms}) starts with an empty committee $A$ and iteratively adds candidates to it; in each iteration, it computes a balanced weight vector for each possible augmented committee that can be obtained by adding a candidate, and then inserts the candidate whose corresponding augmented committee has the highest least member support.
%
We will need the following key technical result, whose proof uses the flow decomposition theorem and is delayed to Appendix~\ref{s:flow}.

\end{algorithm}
\footnotetext{The original algorithm in~\cite{sanchez2016maximin} does not compute balanced weight vectors, but any vector $w$ that maximizes $\supp_w(A)$, which is indeed sufficient for our analysis. 
However, we propose the use of balanced vectors here as they achieve further desirable properties (Lemma \ref{lem:balanced} and Theorem \ref{thm:equivalence}) and because adding such requirement does not seem to cause any additional overhead in complexity.}



\begin{lemma}\label{lem:2sols}
If $(A^*, w^*)$ is an optimal solution to maximin support, and $(A,w)$ is a partial solution with $|A|\leq k$ and $A\neq A^*$, there is a candidate $c'\in A^*\setminus A$ and feasible solution $(A+c', w')$ such that 
$$\supp_{w'}(A+c')\geq \min\Big\{\supp_w(A), \frac{1}{2} \supp_{w^*}(A^*)\Big\}.$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:mms}
The $\MMS$ rule provides a 2-approximation for maximin support.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $(A_i, w_i)$ be the partial solution at the end of the $i$-th round of MMS, and let $(A^*, w^*)$ be an optimal solution. 
We prove by induction on $i$ that $\supp_{w_i}(A_i)\geq \frac{1}{2}\supp_{w^*}(A^*)$, where the case $i=0$ holds trivially as we use the convention that $\supp_w(\emptyset)=\infty$.
Assuming that the inequality holds for $i$, an application of Lemma~\ref{lem:2sols} for $(A_i, w_i)$ and $(A^*, w^*)$ implies that there is a candidate $c'\in A^*\setminus A_i$ and a feasible solution $(A_i+c', w')$ such that 
\begin{align*}
\supp_{w'}(A_i+c') &\geq \min\Big\{\supp_{w_i}(A_i), \frac{1}{2} \supp_{w^*}(A^*)\Big\} \\
 &= \frac{1}{2} \supp_{w^*}(A^*).
\end{align*}
%
As the algorithm is bound to inspect candidate $c'$ in round $i+1$, and compute for it a balanced weight vector $w_{c'}$ which maximizes the support of $A_i+c'$ (by Lemma~\ref{lem:balanced}), the solution $(A_{i+1}, w_{r+1})$ at the end of round $i+1$ must have an even higher support, i.e., %
\begin{align*}
\supp_{w_{i+1}}(A_{i+1}) &\geq \supp_{w_{c'}}(A_i+c) \\ 
  &\geq \supp_{w'}(A_i+c) \geq \frac{1}{2} \supp_{w^*}(A^*).
\end{align*}
%
This completes the proof.
\end{proof}

$\MMS$ is an greedy algorithm with a runtime of $O(\bal \cdot |C|\cdot k)$, where we recall that $\bal$ is the time complexity of computing a balanced weight vector; see Remark~\ref{rem:bal}. 
To conclude the section we mention that a "lazy greedy" version of it can save a factor $\Theta(k)$ in the runtime while keeping the approximation guarantee virtually unchanged. 
In Appendix~\ref{s:lazymms} we prove the following result.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:2eps}
There is an algorithm $\lazy$ that, for any $\eps>0$, offers a $(2+\eps)$-approximation for the maximin support problem, satisfies the PJR property, and executes in time $O(\bal\cdot |C|\cdot \log(1/\eps))$.
\end{theorem}
