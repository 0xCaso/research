Research at Web3 Foundation
===========================

Web3 Foundation Research is being done in an in-house `research team <https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/research_team_members.html>`_, mostly located in Zug (Switzerland), as well as in collaboration with industrial projects and academic research groups. To stay up to date with our research team efforts visit `news <https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/news.html>`_.

Our research focuses on a number of areas that are relevant to decentralised systems:

  - (Proveable) Security, Cryptography, and Privacy
  - Decentralised Algorithms: Consensus and Optimization
  - Cryptoeconomics and Game Theory
  - Networking

We analyze existing protocols, come up with new ones and specify them. We work closely with development teams to make sure our work is practical and useful in context of Web3 technologies.

Some of our current initiatives:

  - :doc:`Polkadot network protocol research <polkadot>`
  - `Messaging for Web3 initiative <https://github.com/w3f/messaging>`_

Talk to us on Riot at #w3f:matrix.org or on our `forum <https://forum.web3.foundation/>`_.
