Leon joined Web3 Foundation in the beginning of 2020 as a research scientist. His main research areas are verifiable distributed datastructures, messaging protocols and (applied) cryptography. 

**Short Biography:**
Before joining Web3 Foundation, Leon was a PhD student working on post-quantum cryptography at Eindhoven University of Technology, under supervision of Tanja Lange, Daniel J. Bernstein and Andreas Hülsing. His scientific contributions range from theoretical work, like how to model (quantum) attacks, to applied works, including side-channel attacks. He successfully defended his PhD thesis "Attacking Post-Quantum Cryptography" in December 2019. Before his PhD, Leon earned a MSc degree in Industrial and Applied Mathematics from Eindhoven University of Technology.
