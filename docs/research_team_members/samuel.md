I am a microeconomist with an interest in market design, primarily in contracts, auctions, and contests. My main task is to analyze the upcoming parachain auctions. I am also interested in questions pertaining to token price formation and the incentives involved in proof-of-stake protocols. 

I hold a PhD from the University of Basel. I spent postdoc years at Duke University, Basel, Zurich, and St. Gallen.
