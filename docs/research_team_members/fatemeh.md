## Short Bio
At Web3 Foundation I work on a number of tasks as follows.

* research challenges of Polkadot such as interoperability, networking, and auctions
* research project aiming at designing a privacy-enhancing messaging service for decentralized applications
* coordinating our academic collaborations 

Before joining W3F, I obtained my PhD in the Electronic Engineering from KU Leuven in the renowned Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography (COSIC) group, under the supervision of Prof. Claudia Diaz and co-supervision of Dr. Markulf Kohlweiss (University of Edinburgh). I was also affiliated to imec. My PhD thesis was titled "Investigating and Improving Anonymous Communication Systems."

Before going to KU Leuven, I was a research assistant and teaching assistant in the CDC group led by Prof. Johannes Buchmann at TU Darmstadt, where my research focus was on measuring the resilience of anonymous communication networks against denial-of-service attacks and investigating privacy in online social networks. At TU Darmstadt, I was also a teaching assistant for three lectures and five seminars and researcher in the acatech Internet Privacy project. 

I obtained my M.Sc. in Computer Science from Saarland University, where I worked for two years as a part-time student assistant at DFKI (German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence) in the Secure Systems group, led by Dr. Werner Stephan, helping with verifying secure partitioning for the PikeOS operating system.
