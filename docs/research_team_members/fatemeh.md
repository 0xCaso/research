# Fatemeh Shirazi

At Web3 Foundation I work on a number of tasks as follows.

* research challenges of Polkadot such as interoperability, networking, and auctions
* a research project aiming at designing a privacy-enhancing messaging service for decentralized applications
* coordinating our academic collaborations

## Research Interests
* Blockchain technologies
* Privacy-enhancing technologies, in particular, anonymous communication networks
* Online voting systems


## **Short Bio** 

Before joining W3F, I obtained my PhD in the Electronic Engineering from KU Leuven in the renowned Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography (COSIC) group, under the supervision of Prof. Claudia Diaz and co-supervision of Dr. Markulf Kohlweiss (University of Edinburgh). I was also affiliated to imec. My PhD thesis was titled "Investigating and Improving Anonymous Communication Systems." I obtained my M.Sc. in Computer Science from Saarland University, where I worked for two years as a part-time student assistant at DFKI (German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence) in the Secure Systems group, led by Dr. Werner Stephan, helping with verifying secure partitioning for the PikeOS operating system.
