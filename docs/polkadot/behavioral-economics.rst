This chapter covers the research field of behavioral economics, which focuses on human interaction with the protocol and analyzes situations where the behavior of the users deviate from rational expectations. One such deviation stems from limited cognitive resources of users which complicate the efficient selection of suitable validators. To help the users, we are researching tools to provide an optimal selection based on userâ€™s preferences. Another research area is the experimental investigation of the parachain slot auctions.
