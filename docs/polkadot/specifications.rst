Specifications
==============

An essential step in turning our research into real-world applications is the creation of detailed technical specification. Therefore, for core protocols, our research extends into the creation and maintenance of technical specification and the review of code implementing them.

Polkadot Protocol
-----------------

Although the Polkadot Protocol Specification currently focuses on how to implement the Polkadot Host, it also contains chapters with details on the Polkadot Runtime, as well as various encodings and APIs. We assume that this document is mostly of interest to engineers wishing to implement parts of or inter-operating with the Polkadot Protocol.

We also provide a html version of this document under `spec.polkdot.network <https://spec.polkadot.network>`_.
