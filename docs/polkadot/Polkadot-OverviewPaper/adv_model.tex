\section{Adversarial Model of Polkadot}

\paragraph{Rationality:} In Polkadot, we assume that adversaries has a rational economic incentives and their computational power is  polynomially bounded. Informally, it means that they attack if and only if their attack gain is greater or equal than/to the attack loss. 

\paragraph{Adversarial Quotient:} We do not have any limitation on collaboration between parties in Polkadot which are validators, nominators, collators and fishermen. However, we assume at most $\frac{1}{3}$ of the  total stake by nominators and validators can belong to malicious validators and nominators. 
We similarly assume that at most quarter of selected validators for an era can be malicious while we do not have a limitation on parachain validators of a parachain e.g., all can be malicious.  
The adversarial assumption on collators depends on the parachain type. If the parachain is private, we assume that there is at least one honest collator. Otherwise, we assume that at least majority of collators are honest.

\paragraph{Keys:} We assume that  malicious parties generate their keys with an arbitrary algorithm while  honest ones always generate their keys securely.

\paragraph{Network and Communication:} All validators have their own local clock. We do not rely on any central clock in Polkadot. We assume partially synchronous network between validators and collators. It means that a message sent by a validator arrives to other validators at most $\D$ times later where $\D$ is an unknown parameter. So, we rely on an eventual delivery.
We also assume that collators and fishermen are able to connect to relay chain network to submit their reports.
