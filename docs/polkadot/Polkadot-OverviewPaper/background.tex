\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
& \textbf{Name}  & \textbf{Definition} \\
\hline
& Era  & a period for which a new validator set is decided by NPoS \\
& Epoch & a period for which randomness is generated by BABE\\
& BABE Slot & a period for which a relay chain block is produced \\
& GRANDPA Rounds & states of the GRANDPA algorithm which lead to a new relay chain block being finalised  \\
& Shuffle &  \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\eray{}{-comment: The last line of the table does not fit the page size. I tried to solve it below. Remove the above table if you agree.-}
