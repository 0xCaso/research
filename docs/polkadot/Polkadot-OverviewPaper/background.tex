\alfonso{}{I think the table should contain more information. I would add a) possibly longer descriptions, b) a reference to the section that introduces them (and where we give an even longer description + its reason of being), and c) their lengths in seconds/minutes/hours, where we put a big note saying all lengths are tentative and subject to change considerably.}
\alfonso{}{Also, we should either add "session" to the table, or remove all mentions of sessions. Simplifying could be a good idea, so maybe the latter?}
