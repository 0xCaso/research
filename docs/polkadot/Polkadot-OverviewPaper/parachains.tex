\subsection{Parachains}
 \paragraph{Block Production}

 \paragraph{Validity and Availability}
 Once a block is created it is important that the parachain blob is available for a while.
 The naive solution for this would be broadcasting/gossip the parachain blobs to all, which is not a feasible option because the parachain blobs are big.
 We want to find an efficient solution to ensure parachain blobs from any recently created parachain block are available.

To this end we designed an availability scheme that uses erasure coding \cite{} to distribute the parachain PoV to all validators.
When any misbehaviour, unavailability particularly in relation to invalidity, is detected the PoV can be reconstructed from the distributed erasure coded pieces.
