\subsection{Networking}

We need networking for a number of components of Polkadot.
These components are: the consensus protocol GRANDPA,
the block production mechanism for relay chain, receiving of parachain blocks,
distribution and recovery of erasure coded pieces for the availability and validity scheme, and the
interchain messaging scheme.


We use gossiping for all parts, except distributing and recovery of erasure coded pieces for the availability and validity mechanism.
