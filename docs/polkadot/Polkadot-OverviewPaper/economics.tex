\subsection{Economics and Incentive Layer}\label{sec:economics}

Polkadot will have a native token called DOT. Its various functions are described in this section.



\subsubsection{NPoS rewards and inflation}

In this section we consider NPoS rewards, i.e.~payments to validators and nominators coming from the minting of new tokens, 
in normal circumstances. In particular we do not consider rewards from transaction fees, slashings, nor rewards to fishermen 
and other reporters of offenses; these will be analyzed in further sections. 
NPoS rewards are the main driver of inflation in the system. 
This is because they are the only mechanism that mints new tokens, and because Treasury expenditure is designed to match 
the net token burning caused by the transaction fees and slashings mechanisms (see the section on Treasury). 
Thus, it is natural to also study our inflation model in this section.

Recall that, according to the NPoS protocol, both validators and nominators stake DOTs. 
They get paid roughly proportional to their stake, but can be slashed up to $100\%$ in case of a misconduct. 
We remark that, even though they are actively engaged for only one era at a time (where one era lasts approximately one day), 
they can be engaged for an unlimited number of consecutive eras. 
Furthermore, for added security, their stake remains locked for several weeks after their last active era, 
to keep them liable to slashing in case an offense is detected late.

\paragraph{Staking rate, interest rate, inflation rate.} Let the "staking rate" be the total amount of DOTs 
currently staked by validators and nominators, divided by the current total DOT supply. 
Their average interest rate will be a function of the staking rate:%
\footnote{As we explain below, validators and nominators are not all paid exactly the same 
interest rate at a given time; in particular, validators are generally paid more than nominators.  
The average interest rate is simply the total payout divided by the total amount staked.}
if the staking rate dips below a certain target value (be to selected by governance), 
the average interest rate will increase, thus incentivizing more participation in NPoS, and vice versa. 
For instance, a target value of $50\%$ could be selected for the staking rate as a middle ground between security 
and liquidity. If the average interest rate is set to $20\%$ p.a.~at that staking rate value, 
then we can expect to maintain an inflation rate (due to NPoS rewards) of $50\%\times 20\% = 10\%$ on average. 
Hence, by controlling the staking rate we also control the inflation rate. 


\paragraph{Rewards across validator slots.} Once the total payout for the current era is computed 
as a function of the staking rate according to the paragraph above, we need to establish how it is distributed.
Recall that the NPoS validator selection protocol (see Section~\ref{sec:validators}) 
partitions all validators' and nominators' stake into the different validator slots 
(where a nominator's stake can be fractionally split among several slots), so as to make the slots' 
stake backings as high and as uniformly distributed as possible, hence ensuring security and decentralization. 
A further incentive mechanism we set, to ensure decentralization over time, 
is \emph{paying validator slots equally for equal work, NOT proportional to their backings}. 
As a consequence, nominators inside a validator slot with more backing will be paid less per staked DOT 
than nominators backing a less popular validator. Hence, they will be incentivized to change 
their preferences over time, converging to the ideal case where all slot backings are equal.

In particular, we devise a point system where validators accumulate points for payable actions performed, 
and at the end of each era validator slots are rewarded proportional to their points. 
This ensures that validators are always incentivized to stay efficient and highly responsive.
Examples of payable actions are: producing a block in BABE, validating a parachain block, etc.

\paragraph{Rewards within a validator slot.} As a nominator's stake can be split among several slots, 
that nominator's payout in an era corresponds to the sum of her payouts relative to each of these slots. 
Within a validator slot, the payment is as follows: 
First, the validator is paid his commission fee, which is an amount entirely up to him to decide and 
publicly announced before nominators select their preferences for the era. 
This fee is intended to cover the validator's operational costs. 
Then, the remainder is shared among all parties (both validator and nominators) proportional to their stake within the slot. 
In other words, the validator is paid twice: once as a non-stake validator with a fixed commission fee, and once as staked nominator. 
Notice that a higher commission fee means a higher total payout for the validator and lower payouts to his nominators, 
but since this fee is published in advance, nominators will generally prefer to back validators with lower fees. 
We thus let the market regulate itself. Validators who have built a strong reputation of reliability and performance 
may be able to charge a higher commission fee, which is fair.

\paragraph{Remark.} As our decision to reward validator slots equally for equal actions independently of their stake 
is likely to raise eyebrows, we provide further arguments for it. 
First, notice that since validators are paid well and the number of slots is limited, 
 candidates have an incentive to ensure a high enough backing to get elected, 
and we expect to have enough competition so that the minimum required backing is very high. 
Furthermore, even if the payouts are roughly the same across slots, within a slot each nominator and validator 
gets paid proportional to their stake, hence there is always an individual incentive to increase one's own stake. 
Finally, if a validator considers that his slot has more backing than necessary, he can either increase his 
commission fee (which has the effect of increasing his own reward at the risk of pushing some nominators away),
or he can create a new candidate node and split his stake and nominators' support between all his nodes. 
On this last point, we welcome individuals and companies with multiple validator nodes (and even aim to make their 
logistics simpler), so long as they disclose such correlations to nominators.


\subsubsection{Relay-chain transaction fees and block limits}

\paragraph{Limits on resource usage.} Every relay-chain block can process a limited number of transactions, in order to ensure it can be processed efficiently even on less powerful nodes, 
and avoid delays in block production.
