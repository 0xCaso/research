\section{Polkadot's Sub-protocols and Components}\label{sec:components}
%\begin{samepage}
Next, we summarise Polkadot functionality shortly for an overall picture and then continue to describe the individual sub-protocols and components. We conclude with a summary and description of what each sub-protoclol and components achieve in Section \ref{sec:summary}. 

%Polkadot consists of a main chain called the relay chain and multiple sharded chains called parachains. 
The relay chain is maintained by validators that are selected through the NPoS scheme \ref{sec:validators} and is responsible for producing blocks of the relay chain \ref{sec:babe} and keeping the state of all the parachains \ref{sec:relaychain}.
These validators need to vote on the consensus over all the parachains, see the consensus scheme \ref{sec:grandpa} for more details.
The security goal of Polkadot is to be Byzantine fault tolerant when the participants are rational (see \ref{sec:economics} for more detail on incentives and economics).
Collators and fishermen that are responsible for parachain block production \ref{sec:parachainblockproduction} and reporting invalid parachain blocks respectively.
The parachain validators assigned to each parachain validate each parachain block and are responsible to keep it available, see \ref{sec:validity-and-availability}. Moreover, another feature of Polkadot is enabling interchain messaging among parachains, see \ref{sec:XCMP} for more details.
Furthermore, Polkadot has a decentralised governance scheme \ref{sec:governance} that can change any Polkadot design decisions and parameterisation.
Furthermore, we review some of the primitives that Polkadot sub-protocols are suing such as the cryptographic keys and networking scheme in Section \ref{sec:crypto} and Section \ref{sec:networking}, respectively.

\section{Summary and Achieved Goals}\label{sec:summary}
In this section we summarise Polkadot's components and describe what they aim to achieve. 

Nominated Proof-of-Stake or NPoS (Section~\ref{sec:validators}) is our adaptation of PoS where an unlimited number of token holders can participate as nominators, backing with their stake a large but limited set of validators. This paradigm achieves high levels of security and scalability simultaneously, as well as an unprecedented level of decentralization by ensuring a property known in voting theory as proportional justified representation \cite{sanchez2017proportional, brill2017phragmen}. Nominators, who are economically vested in the performance of validators, act as watchdogs monitoring the system security. Based on the nominators' expressed preferences over candidates, at the start of every era the system selects a set of validators with stake backings that are as high and as evenly distributed as possible. Nominators are also economically disincentivized from concentrating their votes on too few validators, which helps maintain the system decentralized over time. Furthermore, the election mechanism is highly adaptive to sudden changes, such as some validators being kicked out after a slashing event, as it automatically redistributes the nominators' backings even when the votes themselves do not change. 

Thanks to the NPoS guarantee that every validator is well backed, the availability and validity scheme (Section~\ref{sec:validity-and-availability}) can ensure that any attack on the validity of Polkadot is very expensive in expectation. In fact, the entirety of Polkadot's economic security backs every parachain. 
This is in stark contrast to having, say, 100 independent PoS-based blockchains with an equivalent sum total of stake, where on average each blockchain is backed by 1/100-th of the stake, and thus only benefits from 1/100-th the level of security.  

For this to work, we need to be able to revert the chain until we know with good probability that all parachains are correct. This means that we need to be able to reorganise the chain and for that the chain needs to be capable of forking. Thus we use a block production mechanism, BABE \ref{sec:babe}, that while run by validators, has similar properties to proof-of-work chains. Specifically we can use the longest chain rule as part of our consensus, and that the next block producer is not known in advance. On its own BABE would require us to wait a long time after a block is produced for finality, when we expect with high probability that a block would never be reverted. Slow finality is required in some circumstances to deal with challenges to availability. Most of the time, however, we would prefer to finalise blocks much faster.  For this purpose, we finalise blocks using GRANDPA \ref{sec:consensus}, a finality gadget that is cleanly separated from block production, which allows for the adaptiveness that is necessary to get more efficiency when validity and availability are guaranteed. . 

If an account on one parachain sends tokens to another parachain, then XCMP \ref{sec:XCMP} ensures that this message is delivered correctly. It is sent at a speed which is not dependent on how long it takes to finalise blocks, which means that it needs to deal with the possibility of Polkadot forking. The parachain and XCMP logic ensure that a fork of the relay chain defines a consistent history of Polkadot and so that messages only arrive when they have been sent previously in the history defined by this fork. If the token transfer is carried out in conjunction with SPREE modules then that ensures that so long as the parachains execute correctly then tokens can only be created and destroyed in an agreed upon way. In turn the correct execution of the chains code is guaranteed by the availability and validity scheme. SPREE ensures that this code is correct as well, even though chains can change their own code.

The governance mechanism \ref{sec:governance} allows Polkadot dot-holders to participate in the decision-making process rather than being imposed changes to the system by a central authority or in the case of some decentralised systems, the developers of the system .
