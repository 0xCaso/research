\section{Overview and Components}\label{sec:components}
%\begin{samepage}
Next, we summarise Polkadot functionality shortly for an overall picture and then continue to describe the individual components to show how to achieve that functionality.

Polkadot consists of a main chain called the relay chain and multiple sharded chains called parachains. The relay chain is maintained by validators that are selected through the NPoS scheme \ref{sec:validators} and is responsible for producing blocks of the  Relay Chain \ref{sec:babe} and keeping the state of all the parachains \ref{sec:relaychain}.
These validators need to vote on the consensus over all the parachains, see the consensus scheme \ref{sec:grandpa} for more details.
The security goal of Polkadot is to be Byzantine fault tolerant when the participants are rational (see \ref{sec:economics} for more detail on incentives and economics).
For parachains, there are additional actors called collators and fishermen that are responsible for parachain block production \ref{sec:parachainblockproduction} and reporting invalid parachain blocks respectively.
The parachain validators assigned to each parachain validate each parachain block and are responsible to keep it available, see \ref{sec:validity-and-availability}. Moreover, another feature of Polkadot is enabling interchain messaging among parachains, see \ref{sec:XCMP} for more details.
Furthermore, Polkadot has a decentralised governance scheme \ref{sec:governance} that can change any Polkadot design decisions and parameterisation.
