\section{Overview and Components}\label{sec:components}

Next we summarise Polkadot functionality shortly for an overall picture and then continue to describe the individual components to achieve that functionality.

Polkadot is a multi-chain system with shared security guarantees. Polkadot consists of a main chain called the Relay Chain and multiple parallel chains
called Parachains. The relay chain is maintained by validators that are selected through the NPoS scheme \ref{sec:validators} and is responsible for keeping the state of all the parachains \ref{sec:relaychain}.
These validators need to vote on the consensus over all the parachains, see the consensus scheme \ref{sec:grandpa} for more details.
The security goal of Polkadot is to be Byzantine fault tolerant when the particpants are rational (see \ref{sec:economics} for more detail on incentives and economics).
In addition, the validators are assigned to parachains by dividing the validators set into random disjoint subsets that are each assigned to a particular parachain.
For the parachain, there are additional actors called collators and fishermen that are responsible for parachain block production \ref{sec:parachainblockproduction} and reporting invalid parachain blocks respectively.
The parachain validators assigned to each parachain validate each parachain block and are responsible to keep it available. For this purpose, they create erasure coded pieces from the parachain blocks and distribute
them to all the remaining validators, see \ref{sec:validity-and-availability}. Moreover, another feature of Polkadot is enabling interchain messaging among parachains, see \ref{sec:ICMP} for more details.
Furthermore, Polkadot has a decentralised governance scheme \ref{sec:governance} that can change any Polkadot design decisions and parameterisation.
