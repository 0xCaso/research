\subsection{Relay Chain State Machine}\sec{relaychain}

Formally, Polkadot is a replicated sharded state machine where shards are the parachains and Polkadot relay chain is part of the protocol ensuring global consensus among all the parachains. Therefore the Polkadot relay chain protocol, can itself be considered as a replicated state machine on its own. In this sense, this section describes the relay chain protocol by specifying the state machine governing the relay chain. To that end, we describe the relay chain state and the detail of state transition govern by transactions grouped the relay chain blocks.
