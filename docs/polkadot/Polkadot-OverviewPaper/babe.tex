\paragraph{Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension (BABE)}

In Polkadot, we produce relay chain blocks using our Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension protocol, abbreviated BABE. BABE assigns validators randomly to blocks production slots using  the randomness generated with blocks. These assignments are completely private until the assigned parties produce the block.
