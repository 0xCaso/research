\section{Introduction}
Say something in line with: blockchain are valuable technologies because...

Currently there have been hundreds chains implemented in the wild for various functions.
(maybe a table with 10 famous but very different chains?)
Each one has different characteristics and their own security set up.

There is a need for a system that can connect this heterogenous chains.

Moreover, having multiple security set ups causes a split in the security these systems can provide.
Gathering all this security power and have a shared security system increases security substantially.
