\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Until recently, most of the applications on the web were controlled in a centralised fashion.
We refer not to the centralisation of physical infrastructure, which is often economically efficient, but rather to the logical centralisation of the ability to deploy, take down, alter, and change the rules of the application.
Two good examples are Google and Facebook: while they do have servers all around the world, they are each ultimately controlled by a single legal entity.

Giving a central entity control over a system comes with risks for users and application developers.
The central entity can stop the service at any moment, can sell users' data depending on the jurisdictions they provide service to and manipulate how the service is working without user consent.
With the need for security and the urge for more freedom and fairness, the era of decentralised web applications, where no single entity can control the system, is emerging.
This decentralised web is comprised of many types of applications such as \handan{games, storage, decentralised exchanges, auctions, financial systems, etc.}{ we may add some references for each applications.}

One of the fundamental challenges of the decentralised web is keeping state. There is no central entity who follows the current state or can decide what the current valid state is if there is any doubt.
Blockchains are one of the technologies who address this problem.

In order to make the decentralised web usable for end-users, these separate blockchains need to interact, otherwise, each will become isolated and not adopted by as many users, and the \handan{sum}{replace: overall?} functionality of the system will be insufficient to compete with the centralised web. \handan{However, to interact with different chains, we need to build in interoperability mechanisms, which introduces challenges. Many of these challenges arise from the ways that different blockchains have different technical characteristics.}{Therefore, interoperability mechanisms are urgent for blockchain systems but such mechanisms bring along new challenges. Many of these challenges arise because of different technical infrastructures and functionalities that blockchains have.} For example, \handan{Bitcoin and Ethereum}{refs} are proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains where \handan{preventing the control of the whole system by one entity}{replace: decentralization?} is carried out by introducing \handan{challenges}{maybe puzzle or something else is better than `challenges' not to confuse with the challenges that we talked one sentence before} that need a large amount of \handan{processing}{maybe computing?} power to solve. Their security relies on whether this amount of processing power exceeds the amount of processing power any single entity would possibly have. An alternative to PoW are proof-of-stake (PoS) systems, where the entities who control the system have to lock a large amount of funds and would be punished if they misbehave in any way.
The security relies on the fact that the total amount of locked funds exceeds the budget any adversary is able to invest in the attack.
These technical differences present difficulties for one blockchain to be able to trust another.

\handan{}{this paragraph looks like repetition of the previous one. Maybe it is better to combine them.}Currently, there have been hundreds of chains implemented in the wild for various functions and non-compatible underlying technology.
Most one of these systems have different properties they aim to achieve and certain security threshold that they set up.
Hence, there is a need for a system that can connect these heterogeneous chains.
Moreover, having multiple security setups causes a split in the security these systems can provide. Gathering all this security power and have a shared security system increases security substantially.

\handan{}{we need to improve this paragraph}In this paper, we introduce Polkadot, a multi-chain system with shared security guarantees.
Polkadot consists of the main chain called the \emph{Relay Chain} that guarantees the security and multiple heterogeneous parallel chains called \emph{Parachains}.
The security goal of Polkadot is to be Byzantine fault-tolerant. Polkadot enables the parachains to communicate together and have shared security.

\handan{Furthermore, scalability is another challenge for blockchains to make them comparable with centralised services in functionality.}{it may be better to talk about it when we mention challenges of interoperability}
Polkadot's hierarchical structure addresses this challenge.

\include{comparison}

%The paper is organised as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:properties} we review the properties that Polkadot is aiming for and Section~\ref{sec:preliminiary} examines the structural components and roles that we defined for Polkadot.
%Section~\ref{sec:components} presents all the underlying components including protocols and primitives that have been designed for Polkadot as well as a note about incentives and economics.
