This chapter covers the economic research done at the Web3 Foundation. 

We use tools from microeconomics, behavioral economics, and game theory to analyze different aspects of the protocol.

.. This chapter covers the different economic aspects considered in the Polkadot protocol. It explains the fundamental mechanisms of the native token DOT, providing information on inflation, NPoS payments, and calculation of transaction fees. A substantial part of Polkadotâ€™s value proposition is the ability to provide shared security for decentralized applications which can enter the ecosystem by docking onto the Relay Chain. Those Parachains are application-specific data structures that are globally coherent and validatable by the validators of the Relay Chain. The right to participate as a Parachain can be obtained by winning a Blockchain-specific candle auction format, for which we provide a game-theoretical analysis.

.. In addition, this chapter holds sections insights from behavioral economic projects.
