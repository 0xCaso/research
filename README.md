# Research

Web3 Foundation Research is being done in an in-house research team as well as in collaboration with various projects and reasearch groups. The in-house team is mostly located in Zug, Switzerland. 

Our research generally focuses on areas of:
- Decentralised algorithms: consensus, optimization, game theory
- Cryptography
- Networking

Some of our current initiatives:
- [GRANDPA finality gadget](https://github.com/w3f/consensus/blob/master/pdf/grandpa.pdf)
- [Polkadot specification](https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-re-spec)
- [Messaging for Web3 initiative](https://github.com/w3f/messaging)
- [Schnorr-Dalek Rust crypto](https://github.com/w3f/schnorr-dalek)
