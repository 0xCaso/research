# Research

Web3 Foundation Research is being done in an in-house research team as well as in collaboration with various projects and reasearch groups. The in-house team is mostly located in Zug, Switzerland. 

Our research generally focuses on areas of:
- Decentralised algorithms: consensus, optimization, game theory
- Cryptography
- Networking

Some of our current initiatives:
- [Polkadot network protocol research](polkadot/README.md)
- [Messaging for Web3 initiative](https://github.com/w3f/messaging)

Talk to us on Riot at #w3f:matrix.org or on our [forum](https://forum.web3.foundation/).
